              <p class="design">Hello! My name is Priscilla Wong and I am 22 years old. I graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. Being a recent college grad, I have been on the search for a job but also exploring other options as well! Professionally, I am currently pursuing jobs involving marketing, social media, and graphic design and jobs where I can build on these skills. Graphic design is something I have been interested in since high school and was able to improve on while I was in college working for my school's newspaper and I hope to be able to continue to grow my skills in graphic design in my future jobs.</p>
              <p class="design">My hobbies include binge watching tv shows, interior design, traveling, and eating dessert! My favorite tv show at the moment is This Is Us. My favorite places that I have traveled to are Greece and Italy. Even better than going to these places is the food and dessert available!</p>
