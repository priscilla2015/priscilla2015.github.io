			<h1 class="blogtitle">My Recent Trip to New York City: Day 3</h1>
			<img class="blog" src="images/blogpost1/stanten.jpeg">
      <p class="bold">Day 3</p>
      <p class="paragraphs">We started the day off by taking the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. What is great about the ferry is that it is free both ways, you get to see the Statue of Liberty from afar, and the trip is pretty quick, about 15 to 20 minutes. While being on Staten Island, we went to try some New York Pizza at Pier 76. The pizza here was AMAZING and would definitely recommend if you are in the area, since the place is about two blocks from the ferry station.</p>

      <p class="center">Next stop on our itinerary was going to Brooklyn and seeing the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

      <p class="paragraphs">Right before walking the bridge, we went to have pizza at Grimaldi's Pizzeria and the place was crowded. Instead of waiting in line outside in the cold, we ordered our pizza to go and it was definitely quicker than waiting in line. We walked towards the Brooklyn Bridge eating the pizza.  The walk onto the bridge was quite a long walk but worth seeing the view. Next stop of the day was the Vietnam Memorial.</p>

      <p class="center">The memorial breathtaking and worth a visit. They displayed letters the soldiers and parents had written, and they were truly touching.</p>
      <img class="blog" src="images/blogpost1/vietnammemorial2.jpeg">
      <p class="center">To follow up the Vietnam Memorial was the 9/11 Memorial, which was gorgeous but even more beautiful at night.</p>

      <p class="center">Right outside the 9/11 Memorial was the Westfield World Trade Center. The shopping mall had amazing architecture and featured some amazing shops as well.</p>

      <p class="center">We then had dinner and dessert in this shopping mall at Eataly.</p>

      <p class="paragraphs">Our last stop of the night was right outside the shopping center and was the One World Observatory. The view from the observatory was breath taking. With views of the different boroughs in the city.</p>
